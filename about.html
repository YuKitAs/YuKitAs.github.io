      > Hallo, I'm YuKitAs, just another full-time Backend developer currently living and working in Germany.
        Besides coding and interacting with data, I'm also into a wide range of creative stuff.

        photos (mainly shot with an old Canon EOS 60D) and drawings (mostly created with stylus pen on mobile phones).

      > Not being a big fan of those well-known image-sharing sites,
        I built this static site with Jekyll, pure HTML5, SCSS and JavaScript ES6 without applying any popular libraries or frameworks - and yeah it was fun :)
        Neither did I choose any color schemes or fancy fonts, as I'd like to keep the site as straightforward <strike>and boring</strike> as possible.
        In the meanwhile, I'm constantly learning and trying to make small improvements.
        The source code can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/YuKitAs/YuKitAs.github.io">GitHub repo</a>, of course.

      * CHANGELOG-2: created scripts to auto-generate the manifest and HTML pages for photos, in order to minimize potential human errors from unnecessary manual work.<br>
      * CHANGELOG-1: added a brief description for each photo category.
