      > Hi, I'm YuKitAs, a full-time Backend developer currently working in Germany. <br>
      > Besides programming, I'm keen on a wide range of creative things. <br>
      > As you may already see, here list random collections of some of my amateur
        works since I'm not a big fan of those well-known image-sharing sites. <br>
      > This simple <strike>and boring</strike> static site is built with pure HTML, SCSS and JavaScript ES6
        without applying any library or framework - and yeah it was fun :)
        The source code can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/YuKitAs/YuKitAs.github.io">GitHub repo</a>.

      > My passion for photography is probably inherited from my father.
        In 2016 I decided to focus on wildlife photography, as I've always had an affinity for animals.
        It's been a tough challenge for me, requiring tons of patience, sensitive perception, high agility,
        professional equipments as well as knowledge of the behaviors and habits of wild animals.
        Being a beginner, I'll sometimes visit wildlife parks for practice.

      > I used to paint a lot with oil and gouache in childhood, draw Manga sketches with mechanical pencils during my school time and give away most of the drawings. <br>
      > It was on my birthday in 2015 when I developed an interest in drawing stuff on my smartphone.
        Imagine you can draw and edit anywhere and anytime with simply a non-luxury stylus pen. It's much less time-consuming.
        And what's more, you can send a hand-made pic to friends while still keep the original copy for yourself. <br>
      > However, I haven't got much time for this new hobby. In 2017, suggested by a friend, I created a sticker set on Telegram with 50 stickers drawn on smartphone.
        In the meanwhile it's a pleasure to have known it has been liked by hundreds of Telegram users.
        If you're also using Telegram and love to try new stickers, just click <a href="https://t.me/addstickers/pichuchu">here</a>.
