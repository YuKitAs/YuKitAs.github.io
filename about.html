        Besides coding, I'm keen on a wide range of creative stuff.

      > Not being a big fan of those well-known image-sharing sites,
        I built this static site with Jekyll (you know that), pure HTML5, SCSS
        and JavaScript ES6 without applying any popular library or framework - and yeah it was fun :) Neither did I use
        any color scheme or fancy font, just tried to keep it in a style as straightforward <strike>and boring</strike> as possible.
        In the meanwhile, I'm also constantly learning and trying to make small improvements.
        The source code can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/YuKitAs/YuKitAs.github.io">GitHub repo</a>.
