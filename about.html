      > Hi, I'm YuKitAs, a full-time Backend developer currently working in Germany. <br>
      > Besides programming, I'm keen on a wide range of creative things. <br>
      > As you may already see, here list random collections of some of my amateur
        works since I'm not a big fan of those well-known image-sharing sites. <br>
      > This simple <strike>and boring</strike> static site is built with pure HTML, SCSS and JavaScript ES6
        without applying any library or framework - and yeah it was fun :)

      > My passion for photography is probably inherited from my father, who sent me my first SLR carema.
        In 2016 I decided to focus on wildlife photography, as I've always had an affinity for animals.
        It's been a tough challenge for me, requiring tons of patience, sensitive perception, high agility,
        professional equipments as well as knowledge of the behaviors and habits of wild animals.
        Being a poor beginner, I'll sometimes visit wildlife parks for practice, shooting photos of animals
        like raccoons, foxes and lynxes in the hope of greeting them one day in the real wild.

      > As for drawing, I used to paint a lot with oil and gouache in childhood, draw Manga sketches with
        mechanical pencils during my school time and give away most of the drawings. <br>
      > It was after I came to Germany when I developed an interest in drawing stuff on the smartphone.
        Imagine you can draw and edit anywhere and anytime with simply a non-luxury stylus pen. It's much less time-consuming.
        And what's more, you can send a hand-made pic to others while still keep the original copy for yourself. <br>
      > In 2017, suggested by a friend, I began to draw stickers for Telegram.
        After one year I finally finished <a href="https://t.me/addstickers/pichuchu">this set</a> with 50 stickers drawn impulsively
        on my 4-inch smartphone. <br>
      > Though I haven't got much time for this new hobby, I'm trying to stay active as much as I can.
        After all, drawing was part of my life, it is and will always be.
